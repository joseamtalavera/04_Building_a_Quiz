# Accessibility Quiz

This is a simple HTML/CSS quiz application designed as a practice project for freeCodeCamp's accessibility course.

- **HTML**: This section contains multiple-choice questions about HTML.
- **CSS**: This section contains a multiple-choice question about CSS, a dropdown question asking if the user is a frontend developer, and a textarea for any additional questions the user might have.
- **Navigation**: The navigation bar allows users to quickly navigate to different sections of the form.
- **Submission**: Users can submit the form by clicking the "Submit" button at the end of the form.
